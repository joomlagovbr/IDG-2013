LIB_PHPASS="phpass"
LIB_PHPASS_XML_DESCRIPTION="phpass is a portable password hashing framework for use in PHP applications. The preferred (most secure) hashing method supported by phpass is the OpenBSD-style bcrypt (known in PHP as CRYPT_BLOWFISH), with a fallback to BSDI-style extended DES-based hashes (known in PHP as CRYPT_EXT_DES) and a last resort fallback to an MD5-based variable iteration count password hashing method implemented in phpass itself."
